{"name":"Sagan","body":"Welcome to the README file\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nWhat is Sagan? \r\n\r\nSagan is an open source (GNU/GPLv2) high performance, real-time log \r\nanalysis & correlation engine.  It is written in C and uses a \r\nmulti-threaded architecture to deliver high performance log & event \r\nanalysis. The Sagan structure and Sagan rules work similarly to the \r\nSourcefire \"Snort\" IDS engine. This was intentionally done to maintain \r\ncompatibility with rule management software (oinkmaster/pulledpork/etc)\r\nand allows Sagan to correlate log events with your Snort IDS/IPS \r\nsystem. Since Sagan can write to Snort IDS/IPS databases via \r\nunified2/barnyard2 or direct SQL access, it is compatible with all \r\nSnort \"consoles\". For example, Sagan is compatible with Snorby \r\n[http://www.snorby.org], Sguil [http://sguil.sourceforge.net], BASE, \r\n and the Prelude IDS framework! (to name a few).\r\n\r\nSagan supports many different output formats,  log normalization \r\n(via liblognorm),  script execution on event and automatic firewall\r\nsupport via \"Snortsam\" (see http://www.snortsam.net).  \r\n\r\nFor more information, please visit the Sagan web site: \r\nhttp://sagan.quadrantsec.com. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","tagline":"Sagan uses a 'Snort like' engine and rules to analyze logs (syslog/event log/snmptrap/etc)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
