#
# [Optional]

# This is the path where Sagan related files are stored.  For example,  
# Unified2 output files would be stored under this path.
#
# [Optional]

# This section defines commonly used ports and protocols.  Rules call these

# Disable DNS warnings.  Sagan will warn every time it has to do a DNS lookup
# when attempting to normalize a log entry.  You typically don't want to
# do DNS lookups with log analysis.  More information can be found at:
# https://wiki.quadrantsec.com/bin/view/Main/SaganDNS.  If it's not possible
# to gather the true TCP/IP address information,  you can supress these 
# warnings here.

# README FIRST! - It is very LIKELY you do NOT want to enable this feature. 
# If the syslog system is feeding you "hostnames" rather than source IP 
# addresses,  Sagan can do a DNS lookup of the source host.   Sagan will cache
# this information,  but there will be a preformance hit.  Make _sure_
# your DNS system settings are correct!

# ignore if recieved.  If these terms are found,  then rule parsing and

# External program/system calls configurations specifics
##############################################################################

# This option calls an external program when an event is triggered by a rule.
# Sagan basically makes a thread and calls the execl() system call.
# Data is supplied to the program being called via standard in (stdin). 
# Data can be sent in a "parsable" or "alert" format.   "parsable" will be
# probably easier for your external program to parse. 
#

##############################################################################
# libesmtp (SMTP/E-mail) specific configuration options
##############################################################################

# If you'd like Sagan to e-mail triggered events to you,  then you'll want
# to configure the below.

# If min_email_priority is set,  then Sagan will _only_ e-mail events equal to
# or less than this priority event.  If left commented our or set to 0, 
# Sagan will e-mail _all_ events.  This option does _not_ over ride rules
# with the "email:" option set! 

; min_email_priority 5

# This is where alerts will be sent if a rule _does not_ have a "email:"
# option.  If a rule does have "email:" option,  then the rules e-mail address
# will over ride this option.  If this option is not set,  then only
# rules with the "email:" option will be sent. 

; send-to sagan-alerts@example.com

# Server information.  This tells Sagan "who" to send e-mail as and where 
# the SMTP server to relay is.  This must be set if the "send-to" option
# set,  or you have rules with the "email:" option!
#

# Unified2 output plug in 
##############################################################################

# This lets Sagan log the Snort's 'Unified2' output format.  This allows 
# events generated by Sagan to be read and queued for external programs 
# like Barnyard2 (http://www.securixlive.com/barnyard2/).  Barnyard2 can 
# the record events in various formats (alert_fast,  log_ascii, 
# log_tcpdump,  Sguil,  MySQL,  PostgreSQL, ODBC, MS-SQL and Oracle).

# Sagan syslog "Sniffier" mode.  (PLOG). Promiscuous syslog injector
##############################################################################

# This lets Sagan "listen" on a network interface via pcap/bpf and "suck"
# up UDP syslog messages.  When it "finds" a syslog message within a packet,
# it injects it into /dev/log.  Basically,  it 'sniffs' syslog messages and
# injects them to your syslog daemon (for archival purposes) and Sagan
# (for analysis).  Good for environments you can't reconfigure syslog
# services.   For more information,  see src/sagan-plog.c.

# Network interface to "sniff" traffic on.
; plog_interface eth0

# Syslog "port" to listen on...

# Where to inject "found" messages to.
; plog_logdev /dev/log

#############################################################################
# Sagan "Snortsam" configuration. 
#############################################################################
#
# This allows Sagan to send block information Snortsam agents.  If a rule 
# has the fwsam: option in it,  the offending IP address can be 
# firewall/blocked. For example,  if a rule is triggered with the fwsam: 
# option,  Sagan can instruct a firewall (iptables/ebtable/pf/iwpf/Cisco/
# Checkpoint/etc) to firewall off the source or destination.
#
# In order for Sagan to send a blocking request to the SnortSam agent,
# that agent has to be listed, including the port it listens on,
# and the encryption key it is using. The statement for that is:
#
# output alert_fwsam: {SnortSam Station}:{port}/{password}
#
#  {SnortSam Station}: IP address or host name of the host where SnortSam is running.
#  {port}:             The port the remote SnortSam agent listens on.
#  {password}:         The password, or key, used for encryption of the
#                      communication to the remote agent.
#
# At the very least, the IP address or host name of the host running SnortSam
# needs to be specified. If the port is omitted, it defaults to TCP port 898.
# If the password is omitted, it defaults to a preset password.
# (In which case it needs to be omitted on the SnortSam agent as well)
#
# More than one host can be specified, but has to be done on the same line.
# Just separate them with one or more spaces.
#
# Examples:
#
# output alert_fwsam: firewall/idspassword
# output alert_fwsam: fw1.domain.tld:898/mykey
# output alert_fwsam: 192.168.0.1/borderfw  192.168.1.254/wanfw

; output alert_fwsam: 127.0.0.1/mypassword

# are loaded in a dynamic method.  That is,  rather than load all these 
# at run time,  they are loaded 'as needed' by the Sagan rule sets.  These
# get triggered by the 'normalize:' flag within a Sagan rule.
